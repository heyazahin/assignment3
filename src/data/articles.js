    title: "Challenges and Transformation in Global Healthcare",
    content: `
Healthcare systems around the world face significant challenges in achieving the ‘quadruple aim’ for healthcare: 
improve population health, improve the patient's experience of care, enhance caregiver experience and reduce the rising cost of care. 
Ageing populations, growing burden of chronic diseases and rising costs of healthcare globally are challenging governments, 
payers, regulators and providers to innovate and transform models of healthcare delivery. 

Moreover, against a backdrop now catalysed by the global pandemic, healthcare systems find themselves challenged to ‘perform’ 
(deliver effective, high-quality care) and ‘transform’ care at scale by leveraging real-world data driven insights directly into patient care. 
The pandemic has also highlighted the shortages in healthcare workforce and inequities in the access to care, 
previously articulated by The King's Fund and the World Health Organization.
